Building:
	- Install libevent and glib
	- Probably adapt paths in Makefile
	- type "make"

Configuration:

  Adapter:
  --------

	  As getstream is supposed to support multiple adapters with the same
	  program instance the configuration starts with an adapter clause:

		  adapter 1 {
			budget-mode	1;
			packet-buffer	50;
			stat-interval	120;
		  };

	  - budget-mode
		Set to "0" disabled the budget mode where getstream
		request a seperate PID filter from the kernels filter. As
		the filters are limited on the full featured cards
		this is only a workaround and may work for 2-3 TV
		Channels. Streaming a full transponder on a full featured
		card is most certainly not possible.
		Getstream automatically disables budget mode when setting
		the filter for bit 0x2000 (Illegal value - tells kernel to
		stream full transponder aka "budget-mode") and setting
		the filter returns an error.

	  - packet-buffer
		Set the amount of packets getstream trys to get from the
		kernels dvr interface. I see typically ~44 Packets/s per
		round read from the kernel. Setting this too high just
		wastes memory (a packet is 188 Bytes) setting it to low
		creates more context-switches and will reduce performance.
			
	  - stat-interval
	  	The interval in seconds you will see the statistics on in the log e.g.

		2007-10-25 08:27:02.323 dvr: inputstats: 149 pids 23259 pkt/s 4372702 byte/s
	  

  Tuning or Card type:
  --------------------

  As getstream supports DVB-C, DVB-T and DVB-S and all need different
  parameters for tuning in on the right transponder here is a short
  introduction on how to enter the right parameters.

  DVB-T:
  -----
    
    There are 6 possible options to list for a DVB-T transponder:

      frequency		- Frequency of transponder in Hz
      bandwidth		- auto, 6 (6Mhz), 7 (7Mhz), 8 (8Mhz)
      transmission-mode	- auto, 2 (2Khz), 8 (8Khz)
      guard-interval	- auto, 4 (1/4), 8 (1/8), 16 (1/16), 32 (1/32)
      hierarchy		- none, auto, 1, 2, 4
      modulation	- auto, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

    Example:

        dvb-t {
          frequency 570000000;
          bandwidth 8;
          transmission-mode auto;
          guard-interval auto;
          hierarchy none;
          modulation auto;
        };


  DVB-S:
  ------
  	DVB-S consists of 2 parts - the LNB and the Transponder config:

	LNB:
		It consists of the LOF1 LOF2 and SLOF. This should be identical
		for nearly all Digital LNBs in Europe. LOF1 and LOF2 are
		the "local osscilator" frequencys used for the Low and High
		Band. The SLOF is the cut off frequency at which the higher
		"Local Osscilator" frequency aka LOF2 will be used. This will
		be signaled to the LNB with the 22Khz pilot tone.

	Transponder:
		The transponder is identified by the frequency, the polarisation
		and the symbol-rate. Additionally one might pass an diseqc 
		id to address the correct LNB in the DiSeq enabled switch.

	dvb-s {
		lnb {
			lof1 9750000;
			lof2 10600000;
			slof 11700000;
		};

		transponder {
			frequency 12266000;
			polarisation h;
			symbol-rate 27500000;
			diseqc 4;
		};
	};
