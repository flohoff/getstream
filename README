Building:
	- Install libevent and glib
	- Probably adapt paths in Makefile
	- type "make"

Configuration:

  Adapter:
  --------

	  As getstream is supposed to support multiple adapters with the same
	  program instance the configuration starts with an adapter clause:

		  adapter 1 {
			budget-mode	1;
			packet-buffer	50;
			stat-interval	120;
			stuck-interval  200;
		  };

	  - budget-mode
		Set to "0" disabled the budget mode where getstream
		request a seperate PID filter from the kernels filter. As
		the filters are limited on the full featured cards
		this is only a workaround and may work for 2-3 TV
		Channels. Streaming a full transponder on a full featured
		card is most certainly not possible.
		Getstream automatically disables budget mode when setting
		the filter for bit 0x2000 (Illegal value - tells kernel to
		stream full transponder aka "budget-mode") and setting
		the filter returns an error.

	  - packet-buffer
		Set the amount of packets getstream trys to get from the
		kernels dvr interface. I see typically ~44 Packets/s per
		round read from the kernel. Setting this too high just
		wastes memory (a packet is 188 Bytes) setting it to low
		creates more context-switches and will reduce performance.
			
	  - stat-interval
	  	The interval in seconds you will see the statistics on in the log e.g.

		2007-10-25 08:27:02.323 dvr: inputstats: 149 pids 23259 pkt/s 4372702 byte/s

	  - stuck-interval
	  	Interval to fire the stuck check timer for e.g. FlexCop cards.
		Default 5 seconds, 0 disables.
	  

  Tuning or Card type:
  --------------------

  As getstream supports DVB-C, DVB-T and DVB-S and all need different
  parameters for tuning in on the right transponder here is a short
  introduction on how to enter the right parameters.

  DVB-T:
  -----
    
    There are 6 possible options to list for a DVB-T transponder:

      frequency		- Frequency of transponder in Hz
      bandwidth		- auto, 6 (6Mhz), 7 (7Mhz), 8 (8Mhz)
      transmission-mode	- auto, 2 (2Khz), 8 (8Khz)
      guard-interval	- auto, 4 (1/4), 8 (1/8), 16 (1/16), 32 (1/32)
      hierarchy		- none, auto, 1, 2, 4
      modulation	- auto, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

    Example:

        dvb-t {
          frequency 570000000;
          bandwidth 8;
          transmission-mode auto;
          guard-interval auto;
          hierarchy none;
          modulation auto;
        };


  DVB-S:
  ------
  	DVB-S consists of 2 parts - the LNB and the Transponder config:

	lnb-sharing	- Boolean When set getstream trys to not send
			  an 22Khz Pilot tone or set high voltage for
			  High/Low band or Polarisation but instead
			  trusts a different card to do all necessary
			  things. Some cards can not disable their power
			  voltage completely so look out for problems.

	lnb
		The config needs to match your LNB (Low Now Block
		converter) on your Dish:

		lof1 	- Local osscilator frequency 1 (Low Band)
		lof2	- Local osscilator frequency 2 (High Band)
		slof	- Local osscilator frequency cut off

		If the transponder frequency is above the slof getstream enables
		the 22Khz Pilot tone to switch the LNB to High Band.

	Transponder:
		frequency	- Frequency of the Transponder in hz.
		polarisation	- Either H or V for Horizontal or Vertical
		symbol-rate	- Symbol Rate - Most European transponders use 27500000
		diseqc		- LNB Diseq code

	dvb-s {
		lnb-sharing yes;
		lnb {
			lof1 9750000;
			lof2 10600000;
			slof 11700000;
		};

		transponder {
			frequency 12266000;
			polarisation h;
			symbol-rate 27500000;
			diseqc 4;
		};
	};
