	getstream -dd -c getstream.conf

Configuration
=============

  Adapter:
  --------

	  As getstream is supposed to support multiple adapters with the same
	  program instance the configuration starts with an adapter clause:

		  adapter 1 {
			budget-mode	1;
			packet-buffer	50;
			stat-interval	120;
			stuck-interval  200;
		  };

	  - budget-mode
		Set to "0" disabled the budget mode where getstream
		request a seperate PID filter from the kernels filter. As
		the filters are limited on the full featured cards
		this is only a workaround and may work for 2-3 TV
		Channels. Streaming a full transponder on a full featured
		card is most certainly not possible.
		Getstream automatically disables budget mode when setting
		the filter for bit 0x2000 (Illegal value - tells kernel to
		stream full transponder aka "budget-mode") and setting
		the filter returns an error.

	  - packet-buffer
		Set the amount of packets getstream trys to get from the
		kernels dvr interface. I see typically ~44 Packets/s per
		round read from the kernel. Setting this too high just
		wastes memory (a packet is 188 Bytes) setting it to low
		creates more context-switches and will reduce performance.

	  - dvr-buffer
		Sets the kernel DVR ring buffer size in bytes (should be
		multiple of PAGE_SIZE e.g. 4096 on 32bit x86) via
		DMX_SET_BUFFER_SIZE. 
			
	  - stat-interval
	  	The interval in seconds you will see the statistics on in the log e.g.

		2007-10-25 08:27:02.323 dvr: inputstats: 149 pids 23259 pkt/s 4372702 byte/s

	  - stuck-interval
	  	Interval to fire the stuck check timer for e.g. FlexCop cards.
		Default 5 seconds, 0 disables.
	  

  Tuning or Card type:
  --------------------

  As getstream supports DVB-C, DVB-T and DVB-S and all need different
  parameters for tuning in on the right transponder here is a short
  introduction on how to enter the right parameters.

  DVB-T:
  -----
    
    There are 6 possible options to list for a DVB-T transponder:

      frequency		- Frequency of transponder in Hz
      bandwidth		- auto, 6 (6Mhz), 7 (7Mhz), 8 (8Mhz)
      transmission-mode	- auto, 2 (2Khz), 8 (8Khz)
      guard-interval	- auto, 4 (1/4), 8 (1/8), 16 (1/16), 32 (1/32)
      hierarchy		- none, auto, 1, 2, 4
      modulation	- auto, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

    Example:

        dvb-t {
          frequency 570000000;
          bandwidth 8;
          transmission-mode auto;
          guard-interval auto;
          hierarchy none;
          modulation auto;
        };


  DVB-S / DVB-S2:
  ------
  	DVB-S consists of 2 parts - the LNB and the Transponder config:

	lnb-sharing	- Boolean When set getstream trys to not send
			  an 22Khz Pilot tone or set high voltage for
			  High/Low band or Polarisation but instead
			  trusts a different card to do all necessary
			  things. Some cards can not disable their power
			  voltage completely so look out for problems.

	lnb
		The config needs to match your LNB (Low Block converter)
		on your Dish - If you have a Ku Band LNB (Normal for
		most of the World) you need these informations:

		lof1 	- Local osscilator frequency 1 (Low Band)
		lof2	- Local osscilator frequency 2 (High Band)
		slof	- Local osscilator frequency cut off

		If the transponder frequency is above the slof getstream
		enables the 22Khz Pilot tone to switch the LNB to
		High Band.

		If you have a C Band LNB you dont have a slof so dont
		configure it.  If you have a multipoint C Band LNB
		you have lof1 and lof2 in case you dont just configure
		the lof1.

	Transponder:
		frequency	- Frequency of the Transponder in hz.
		polarisation	- Either H or V for Horizontal or Vertical
		symbol-rate	- Symbol Rate - Most European transponders use 27500000
		diseqc		- LNB Diseq code

	dvb-s {
		lnb-sharing yes;
		lnb {
			lof1 9750000;
			lof2 10600000;
			slof 11700000;
		};

		transponder {
			frequency 12266000;
			polarisation h;
			symbol-rate 27500000;
			diseqc 4;
		};
	};

	For "DVB-S2" the type obviously has to be changed to "dvb-s2". Also getstream
	need to be compiled against the multiproto header files and you need to be using
	multiproto enabled cards.

  Input:
  ------
	The input section in every stream defines which parts of the
	Transponder needs to be forwarded into this stream. Currently
	there are 3 options.

	pid	- A static pid to forward. Sometimes people want to 
		  have the encryption stuff forwarded e.g. pid 10 and 11

	pnr	- Program number e.g. a full Programm including all pids.

	full	- A full transponder e.g. the same as pid 0x2000.

	Example:
	--------

	input {
		full;
	};

  SAP:
  ------
	Can be used in the output-rtp and output-udp sections to send SAP announcements.

	scope		- Multicast group which is used for the SAP announcemens.
			  Possible values:
			    global	- Global SAP address (224.2.127.254:9875) (default)
			    org		- Organization-local SAP address (239.195.255.255:9875)
			    local	- Local SAP address (239.255.255.255:9875)
			    link	- Link-local SAP address (224.0.0.255:9875)

	sap-group	- Multicast group address which is used for the SAP announcemens (overrides scope).
	sap-port	- Port which is used for the SAP announcemens (overrides scope).
	announce-host	- unused
	announce-port	- unused
	ttl		- TTL for the SAP announcemens.
			  By default the output stream's TTL is used.
	interval	- Announcement interval (in seconds) (default=1).
	playgroup	- SAP/SDP group name.
	uri		- An URI with additional information.
	description	- Stream description.
	email		- EMail contact information (can be used multiple times).
	phone		- Phone contact information (can be used multiple times).
	attribute	- Additional SDP attribute, see RFC2327 for details (can be used multiple times).

	Example:
	--------
	sap {
		scope global;
		interval 5;
		playgroup "TV";
		description "Example TV stream";
		uri "http://example.com";
		email "<Bob Smith> bob@example.com";
		phone "+49 555 555-555";
		attribute "tool:getstream";
		attribute "recvonly";
	};
